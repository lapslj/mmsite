<h3 class="neontitle">THE LONG LIFE OF GOOD SIGNS</h3>
<div class="vendor">
    <p>Neon Williams’ East Somerville shop is
full of signage you won’t find anywhere else,
but recently a customer brought in something
even rarer: a complaint. “He said, hey, this pizza
sign you sold me is broken!” Dave Waller, Neon
Williams co-owner recalls. He looked over the
malfunctioning sign. “I said, I don’t recognize
this piece. When did we sell it to you?” </p>
<p>The sign was from 1975. It had been running
nearly half a century.</p>

<p>That longevity is a primary selling point of
neon. The precisely-bent glass and mechanical induction motors need only occasional
maintenance to keep a neon sign running for
decades. “People get a bit of sticker shock,”
Waller says, but compared to the cheaper alternatives flooding the signage market, these are
“long-lasting pieces”.
</p><p>But the true neon acolytes (a diminished but
steadfast bunch) aren’t likely to wax poetic
about the age. They’ll tell you about its beauty.
</p><p> </p>“It’s a quality of light that’s difficult to
replicate by other means,” Waller says.</p>

<p>
Neon signage creates light by combining a
noble gas - often “classic” red-orange neon,
vivid violet argon, or pinkish helium—with
mercury vapor for intensity, and phosphor or
painted-glass coating for a specific hue. This
specific alchemy produces a vivid, chemical
light uniquely suited to pierce through the rain,
fog, and clouds that might dampen or blot out
other light sources. Compare the arresting brilliance of the Union Oyster House or Paramount
Theater signs downtown with the “false neon”
LED that adorns more recently-built cafes or
taverns and you’ll see it yourself: there’s no
comparison to neon.</p>
<p>This specificity, of course—combined with
the relative cheapness of LED—makes neon signage difficult to service. It’s cost-prohibitive for
most contracting, building, or marketing companies to keep a neon specialist on staff, which
is why Neon Williams is one of the last neon
servicing shops in New England.</p>

<p>You’ve probably passed the shop without
even realizing it. Since its founding in 1934 as
the “Long Life Neon Tube” company, Neon
Williams has had many homes, but today it’s
beside the East Somerville T stop & Brickbottom Studios. It’s just one in a long row of largely-nondescript warehouses.</p>
<div class="sideby"><img src="assets/img/M0503_d.jpg" alt=""><img src="assets/img/M0503_c.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The interior, though, is unforgettable.
Ten-foot glowing-red burlesque dancers; a
ketchup-dripping hot dog the size of a minibus; hundreds of hand-bent fonts promising
long-defunct railroads, hotels, and burger
joints. The heat of the glass torches and the mechanical chunk-click of the motorized signs give
the impression of a magical factory.</p>
<p>The staff are friendly, welcoming, and love
what they do. You’d have to: between the
finickiness of the glass tubing, the chemistry
of the color production and the heavy-voltage
machinery required to blast impurities from the
glass tubing, proper signmaking technique can
take a decade to develop. Apprentices fizzle out
pretty quickly. </p><p>Which makes it all the more miraculous that
one of the last and healthiest centers of neon
expertise is just down the street.
</p>
<img src="assets/img/M0503_f.jpg" alt="">
<p>Neon signs were first demonstrated in 1910, in
a largely identical way to how it is done today.
For the first half of the century, neon signage
was so popular that signmaking was an industry
of careful technique and closely-guarded trade
secrets. This served signmakers well until cheaper and easier-to-install alternatives flooded the
market; now, that tendency towards secrecy
means that many signs, images, and technique
are deeply buried.</p>
<p>What’s been preserved digitally barely
scratches the surface of a century of artisanal
signmaking. People requesting custom signs
from Neon Williams will often go (where else?)
to the Internet for design ideas. “The same seven or eight images always float to the surface,”
Waller says.</p>
<img src="assets/img/M0503_h.jpg" alt="">
<p>To preserve some of what’s lost, Waller keeps
a small library of old neon books, many of them
short-run or self-published by individual shops:
pictures from neon’s heyday that may never
have been digitized.</p>
<p>Waller comes to shop ownership relatively recently. When the eponymous Williams brothers
retired in 2019, Dave Waller, his wife Lynn, and
their friend Tony took it over.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Waller was simply the shop’s
best customer: he’s been collecting neon signs since he was a kid. When he saw a business with
a neon sign, he’d patronize them for years, reminding them periodically that if they ever
wanted to get rid of their sign, consider him
before the town dump.</p>
<p>Waller hastens to clarify that these were, in
and of themselves, good businesses. Remember, neon lasts for decades: a local auto shop or
restaurant with that kind of longevity must be
doing something right</p>
<p>One sign no one was able to save? The old
CITGO sign. If you’re new to the city, you may
never have seen its neon incarnation. “It’s one
of those losses where people don’t even realize
what was lost.”</p>
<div class="sideby"><img src="assets/img/M0503_g.jpg" alt=""><img src="assets/img/M0503_i.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Waller and his staff keep plenty busy with
the signs they have managed to save. When we
visit, he’s packaging relish and mustard glass
drips for a dripping hot dog that by now you
should be able to go see in Worcester</p>
<p>Also: they fixed the pizza sign from 1975. But
nothing lasts forever, even handcrafted strong
neon signs degrade, so the owner might be
back. In another fifty years or so. •</p>
